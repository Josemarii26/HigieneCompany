                <p>The Hygiene Companyâ€™s Stainless Steel Dispensers offer a sleek and effective hygiene solution that will enhance your facilities and corporate image.</p>

                <p>From simple wall-mounted wipes dispensers to multifaceted wipe dispensers with built-in antiviral hand foamers and waste bins, the array of smart dispenser options offered by The Hygiene Company guarantees that all of our clients will find the perfect hygiene solution to meet their every need.</p>


                <p>To ensure they fit in perfectly with the environment in which they are placed, our clients are able to add customised branding to any of our Stainless Steel Wet Wipes Dispensers, as well as choose from two smart finishes: Brushed 304 Stainless Steel or Matt Black Mild Steel Powder Paint.</p>

                <p>Given that it does not support the growth of bacteria and pathogens, stainless steel is one of the most hygienic materials and, therefore, provides greater levels of protection for both your staff and customers. Moreover, it is not only easy to clean and maintain, but it is also corrosion resistant, durable and sustainable, which means that these wipes dispensers are built to last. When combined, these elements make stainless steel the optimal material for wet wipes dispensers.</p>
